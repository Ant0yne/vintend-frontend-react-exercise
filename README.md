##Â Routes

### "/"

The Home Page.
All the offers are display from the oldest created to the newest

### Offers

The offers sort regarding the query:

- Price minimum and maximum
- sort by ascending or descending price
- search by word in offer's name

### Offer/:id

An offer detail found by id in params

## To Do

- better carrousel (better responsive, better scrollbar, etc.)
- better design for search bar (a button to search, design when the input is focus, etc)
- add a screen message when successfully sign up
- when on mobile, opening the sign up and log in modal above it (and not closing it)
- designing the loading page
- designing the 404 page
- dryer code

_not sure_

- merging the sign up and log in modal in one component
- creating a component for the inputs
